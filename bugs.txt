bugs:

with promoted queen at black knight origin square, move checker thinks the piece is a knight not a queen

pond to queen promotion, when the pond hits the original black knight or black bishop square, the queen's attacks become that knight or bishop's attacks. But when it goes to the original rook spot, 
the queen has the original moves so what is to expect???
