bugs:

- king moves into pond check, and checks in general
- Black in checkmate when Queen/other pieces can take attacking piece - checkChecker function
- check's for white does not work


need to implement function to check if king is moving into a check
fix if pieces can kill opponent piece placing king in check
if white in check, game is not functional.

need to implement black castling

For each move, implement an algorithm which goes through every possible move for a certain move through copies of the game
and choose the move with the most favorable outcome for checkmate -> alpha beta pruning

rework checkChecker function:
idea: Use protections for king moves

for blocking:

iterate through the entire board for pieces of the same team, example white pieces for white king
get moves function for the white piece 
for each move from the white piece from the get_moves function, create a copygrid
from the copygrid, place the white piece on the grid using that move and use the loadprotections function
on that grid
if black is still on the king, then blocking failed. 
Keep going until blocking is successful

if blocking is successful, append the move to blockings in the board class

if there are no moves in blocking, then go to king moves
