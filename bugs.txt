bugs:

- black knight moves to block check and black king disappears
- king moves into pond check, and checks in general
- Black in checkmate when Queen/other pieces can take attacking piece - checkChecker function
- pond skips over piece -- fixed
- check's for white does not work


need to implement function to check if king is moving into a check
fix if pieces can kill opponent piece placing king in check
if white in check, game is not functional.

need to implement black castling

For each move, implement an algorithm which goes through every possible move for a certain move through copies of the game
and choose the move with the most favorable outcome for checkmate -> alpha beta pruning
